### About DAppNode

DAppNode is Free Open Source Software ("FOSS") aimed at facilitating the use of decentralized technologies. DAppNode is developed by the DAppNode Association, a Switzerland based voluntary association with the purpose of empowering users to participate in decentralized networks and to help such networks become more resilient by promoting the deployment of more nodes.
The modular structure of the DAppNode FOSS allows for the wrapping of 3rd party software with the intention of facilitating its deployment. In no way we are responsible for the misuse of such software and in no way we warrant its functionalities. We accept no responsibility for its errors, or for the errors that the wrapping process might have introduced. Any usage of DAppNode and a DNP is strictly at your own risk.

### Risks of Operating DAppNode

The use of DAppNode and the 3rd party software included within its different DNPs can lead to loss of money. Blockchain technologies and in particular Ethereum are still experimental systems and ETH and other cryptocurrencies remain a risky investment. You alone are responsible for your actions on DAppNode including the security of your ETH and meeting any applicable minimum system requirements.

Furthermore the Wider Crypto Industry including Ethereum is still nascesnt in most respects: Technologically it remains experimental and as such laws and regulations surrounding the industry are still developing, many of which contrast dramatically with the ideological values of much of the Ethereum community mainly related to censorhip.

Use the 3rd party software included within its different DNPs might be subject to Terms and Conditions of the 3rd party. DAppNode association has done its best to include such Terms and Conditions, however we do not warrant the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of the 3rd party Terms and Conditions. Any reliance you place on such information is strictly at your own risk. We recommend consulting with the 3rd party responsible for the software for its most updated Terms and Conditions.

We make no claims that DAppNode is appropriate or permitted for use in any specific jurisdiction. Access to DAppNode may not be legal by certain persons or in certain jurisdictions or countries. If you access DAppNode, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws.

Some Internet plans will charge an additional amount for any excess upload bandwidth used that isn’t included in the plan and may terminate your connection without warning because of overuse. We advise that you check whether your Internet connection is subjected to such limitations and monitor your bandwidth use so that you can stop DAppNode before you reach your bandwidth limit.

### OFAC + MEV-Boost


The censorship at the crux of this quandary is related to the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) which is one of the enforcement arms of the United States Treasury Department.  OFAC has wide authority over financial transactions and is charged with monitoring and enforcing US financial sanctions against certain countries, organizations, and individuals.  Penalties are strong for OFAC violations and the reach of OFAC extends far beyond US borders; according to OFAC's October 2021 "Sanctions Compliance Guidance for the Virtual Currency Industry", when asked "Who Must Comply with OFAC Sanctions?" the response is as follows:
"All U.S. persons are required to comply with OFAC regulations. This includes all U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents,
wherever located; all individuals and entities within the United States; and all entities organized under the laws of the United States or
any jurisdiction within the United States, including any foreign branches of those entities. Accordingly, anyone engaging in virtual currency
activities in the United States, or that involve U.S. individuals or entities, should be aware of OFAC sanctions requirements and the
circumstances in which they must comply with those requirements.

Depending on the authorities governing each sanctions program, others may also be required to adhere to OFAC sanctions requirements.
For example, OFAC’s Cuba, Iran, and North Korea sanctions programs extend sanctions prohibitions to certain foreign entities owned or
controlled by U.S. persons or U.S. financial institutions. Certain activities by non-U.S. persons that involve the United States, U.S. persons,
or goods or services exported from the United States may also be subject to OFAC sanctions regulations.

Additionally, in most sanctions programs, any transaction that causes a violation — including a transaction by a non-U.S. person that causes
a U.S. person to violate sanctions — is also prohibited. For certain sanctions programs, U.S. persons, wherever located, also are prohibited
from facilitating actions on behalf of non-U.S. persons if the activity would be prohibited by sanctions regulations if directly performed by a
U.S. person or within the United States.

**Strict Liability Regulations**
OFAC may impose civil penalties for sanctions violations generally based on a strict liability legal standard. This means that, in many cases,
a U.S. person may be held civilly liable for sanctions violations even without having knowledge or reason to know it was engaging in such
a violation. As a general matter, however, OFAC takes into consideration the totality of facts and circumstances surrounding an apparent
violation to determine the appropriate enforcement response. "

As such, relay providers offer: 
	- Non-Compliant: relays that attempt to maximize the fees paid to the block proposer by using every possible strategy, including not filtering or censoring any transactions, even those that may be destined to or coming from an address that has been blacklisted by OFAC.  
	- Compliant: relays that attempt to maximize fees paid to the block proposor, but filter out and censor any transactions destined to or coming from an OFAC blacklisted address.
